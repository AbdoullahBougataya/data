In PyTorch, ATen (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/aten) is the tensor library stands for "A Tensor", 
supports tensor operations that dispatches to different backends (CPU, MKL, CUDA, CUDNN, TPU, etc).

Simiary, in TorchArrow, ATab is the table/relational library stands for "A Table", supports table/relational operations
that dispatches to different backends as well (Velox, cuDF, etc).
