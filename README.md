# torchdata

This is a private repo for the rapid development of the [Data Loader revamp](https://github.com/pytorch/rfcs/pull/15/files) and [TorchArrow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXOamK8fGpDH8iQbN0GWuvTbBpYWo29qj_BE75gyXeI/edit#). TorchArrow development is currently inside the private [Velox repo](https://github.com/facebookexternal/f4d/), which you can add yourself to [here](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/opensource/github/repo/517797855566103/contributors) to view, but will eventually move into torchdata.
